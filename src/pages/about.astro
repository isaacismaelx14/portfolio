            <p>
                I'm Isaac Martinez, a Software Architect and Full Stack
                Developer based in Santiago, Dominican Republic. I have a strong
                focus on AI-driven solutions and scalable backend architectures.
            </p>
            <p>
                With over 9 years of experience in Node.js and a deep
                understanding of cloud technologies like AWS, I build systems
                that are not only performant but also secure and reliable. I'm
                passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex business
                problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing dominoes, photography, and
                exploring the latest advancements in AI.
            </p>
